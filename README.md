**Example:** MTN user to MTN user call. Often cheaper or free.

## Off-Net

Communication between different networks.
**Example:** Roshan user to MTN user call in Afghanistan. Usually incurs higher charges.


## Number Normalization

Number normalization is the process of converting phone numbers into a standard, consistent format so that they can be processed correctly by telecom systems, regardless of how they were originally entered or dialed.

- **A Number:** Formats caller’s number (e.g., add country code).  
- **B Number:** Formats receiver’s number.

**Example:**  
- Raw A Number: `00937012*****` → Normalized: `+937012*****`  
- Raw B Number: `07012*****` → Normalized: `+937012*****`


## CRBT (Caller Ring Back Tone)

CRBT is a telecom service that lets users set a custom tone (like a song or message) that callers hear while waiting for the call to be answered.

Key Points:
- Replaces the default ringtone with music, voice, etc.
- Activated via USSD, IVR, app, or SMS.

Summary: Custom tone (song/message) heard by caller while waiting. Can be activated via USSD, IVR, app, or SMS.


## EVD (Electronic Voucher Distribution)

EVD is a system for digitally selling mobile airtime, data, and services without physical scratch cards. Retailers use a digital platform (like a POS, app, or web portal) to top up customer accounts in real time. It reduces costs, improves security, and enables real-time tracking of sales and inventory.

Summary: Digital platform for topping up mobile balances. Replaces scratch cards. Enables real-time recharge, security, and tracking.


## Denomination

## EDR (Event Detail Record)

An EDR logs any network events, such as logins, SMS, handovers, or policy changes.
EDR is used for: Network monitoring, security, and service assurance.


## 2G Networks

2G was the first digital generation of mobile networks, replacing analog systems. It introduced GSM, enabled encrypted voice calls, and brought text messaging to users. It also improved call quality, used radio spectrum (the range of frequencies used for wireless communication) more efficiently, and laid the foundation for 3G, 4G, and 5G Networks.


## 2.5G Networks / GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)

GPRS, also called 2.5G, is a mobile data standard built on 2G networks. It enabled packet-based data transfers at speeds around 56 to 114 Kbps. Operating on both 2G and 3G networks, GPRS powered early mobile internet services like:

- MMS (picture messaging)  
- Web browsing  
- Email

## 3G Networks / UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)

UMTS, known as 3G, brought faster internet and improved voice quality. It enabled:

- Better web browsing  
- Video calling  
- Music/video streaming  
- Support for more advanced mobile apps (e.g., Facebook, YouTube)  

Speeds were typically up to 384 Kbps, and up to 42 Mbps with later upgrades (like HSPA+).


## 4G Networks / LTE (Long-Term Evolution)

LTE, commonly referred to as 4G, is a wireless broadband standard based on 4th generation cellular technology. It delivers high-speed internet to smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices.

LTE supports:

- Live-streaming media  
- Smart cities and IoT  


## VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)

VoIP allows voice and multimedia communication over IP networks (like the internet) instead of traditional phone lines. It is cost-effective, flexible, and supports services like voice calls, video calls, and messaging on various devices.

Examples: Skype, WhatsApp, etc.


## HSPA+ (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access) 

HSPA+ is an enhanced 3G (3.5G/3.75G) mobile broadband technology that offers faster data speeds (up to 42 Mbps download, 11.5 Mbps upload) and lower latency compared to standard 3G.

HSPA+ is backward compatible with older UMTS/3G networks and was widely used before LTE/4G became common.


## IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)

IMSI is a unique number stored on your SIM card that mobile networks use to identify and authenticate you.

**Example IMSI:** `412800734*****`  

- MCC (Mobile Country Code): 412 (Afghanistan)  
- MNC (Mobile Network Code): 80 (Salaam Telecom)  
- MSIN (Mobile Subscriber Identification Number): 0734***** (Subscriber ID)


## Country Code vs Mobile Country Code

The Country Code (like +93 or 0093) is used for making international phone calls to a specific country. For example, when dialing a number in Afghanistan from another country, you'd start with +93.
The Mobile Country Code (MCC) is used internally by mobile networks to identify the country of a mobile subscriber. For Afghanistan, the MCC is 412. It's part of the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) stored on the SIM card and used by the network during registration and authentication.

- **Country Code:** Used for dialing (e.g., +93 for Afghanistan, +1 for the United States, +91 for India).  
- **MCC (Mobile Country Code):** Used by networks to identify country (e.g., 412 for Afghanistan, 310 for United States, 404 for India).


## MNC (Mobile Network Code)

A two or three-digit code that uniquely identifies a mobile network operator within a specific country. It is used in combination with MCC to distinguish between different carriers operating in the same country.

Example MNCs:

- 80 → Salaam Telecom (Afghanistan)
- 01 → AT&T (USA)
- 10 → Airtel (India)
- 01 → T-Mobile (Germany)

Note: The same MNC can exist in different countries but with different MCCs.


## MSIN (Mobile Subscriber Identification Number)

A unique number assigned to each mobile subscriber by their mobile network operator. It identifies the individual user within that operator’s network. The format and length may vary between operators but typically consists of 9–10 digits.

Example MSINs:

- 07341**** → a subscriber on Salaam Telecom
- 98765**** → a subscriber on Airtel India
- 123456**** → a subscriber on Verizon USA


## IVR (Interactive Voice Response)

## Base Station

A base station is a fixed communication location that enables wireless communication between a network and mobile devices. It sends and receives radio signals to/from mobile phones or other wireless devices. It consists of Antennas, transceivers, power supplies, and baseband units.

Examples: Cell towers in mobile phone networks (e.g., 4G, 5G).


## Billing Pulse

Billing Pulse refers to a fixed time unit (e.g., 60 seconds) used to calculate charges for telecom services such as voice calls. Users are billed in increments of this unit, regardless of whether the entire duration is used. 

Example: For a 60-second pulse rate, a 61-second call would be billed as 2 pulses.

Most common billing pulses durations are 1 second, 30 seconds and 60 seconds.

## IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) 

IMEI is a unique 15-digit number that identifies a mobile device. It is used by networks for device authentication and security. It can also help track, block, or blacklist lost or stolen phones.

IMEI numbers are stored in a database called the EIR (Equipment Identity Register)


## EIR (Equipment Identity Register)

EIR is a database in mobile networks that stores lists of mobile device IMEIs, it helps MNOs identify and control devices by classifying them into three lists:

- White List: Allowed devices
- Black List: Blocked (e.g., stolen) devices
- Grey List: Suspicious devices (monitored but allowed)

EIR’s job is to check (using the IMEI number) that every phone call or SMS sent is from a mobile phone authorized to use a mobile network.

EIR helps prevent the use of stolen, faulty, or unauthorized devices on the network.


## MNP (Mobile Number Portability)

Mobile number portability enables mobile phone users to retain a mobile telephone number when changing the mobile network operator.

**Example:** Airtel (India) user on Vodafone (Germany).


## MSRN (Mobile Station Roaming Number) 

MSRN is a temporary telephone number assigned to a mobile station which roams into another numbering area (usually another country).

## VLR (Visitor Location Register) 

VLR is a temporary database in mobile networks that stores subscriber information when a user is roaming. It works with the MSC to track the user's location, authenticate them, and help route calls and messages. The VLR gets data from the HLR and deletes it when the user leaves the area.

## MSC (Mobile Switching Center)

MSC is a key component in 2G/3G mobile networks that manages call switching, mobility, SMS routing, and subscriber authentication. It connects mobile users to other networks (like landlines or the internet).

- Call Switching: Connecting voice calls between users or networks.
- Mobility: Manages the user's location as they move across different cell areas and ensures seamless service continuity through handover between base stations.
